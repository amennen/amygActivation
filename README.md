# Young 2014 run struture:
# blocks of rest, happy, count each 40 seconds
# continuous feedback during the whole happy block
# no feedback condition - same happy task but no feedback 
# we're going to have even/odd judgements instead of counting down so it's not stressful
# 13 blocks of 40 seconds each = 520 seconds (347 TRs) - put 10 TRs from first trigger and then 5 at the end
# 362 TRs total

# let's make them 42 seconds each for the TRs to be right --> 379 TRs total
